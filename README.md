Sorting Algorithm Visualization
This Python program utilizes the Pygame library to visually demonstrate two sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. The program generates a random list of integers and allows the user to observe the sorting process in real-time.

Getting Started::
Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine.
pip install pygame

Clone the repository and run the script:python sorting_visualizer.py

Controls:

R: Reset the list with a new random order.
SPACE: Start sorting the list.
A: Set the sorting order to Ascending.
D: Set the sorting order to Descending.
I: Choose Insertion Sort as the sorting algorithm.
B: Choose Bubble Sort as the sorting algorithm.

Visualization
The visualization window displays the current sorting algorithm, sorting order (Ascending/Descending), and available controls.

Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort:
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Insertion Sort:
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
